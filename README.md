#  commander

This project demonstrates how to develop a command line tool for macOS in Swift. Unlike typical command line tool, this keeps running under Run Loop until user's control-C abortion.  It keeps watching a given directory and report if any files or subdirectories are added or deleted from that directory. 

### Usage

```
commander --watch ~/Desktop
```
